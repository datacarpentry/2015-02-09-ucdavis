<p>This is a an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in 3/4 of a day. They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data.frame, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, and finish with how to calculate summary statistics for each level and a very brief introduction to plotting.</p>

<p>The lessons are written in Rmarkdown. A Makefile generates an html page for each topic using knitr. In the process, knitr creates an intermediate markdown file. These are removed by the Makefile to avoid clutter.</p>
<p>The Makefile also generates a &quot;skeleton&quot; file that is intended to be distributed to the participants. This file includes some of the examples used during teaching and the titles of the section. It provides a guide that the participants can fill in as the lesson progresses. It also avoids typos while typing more complex examples. Each topic generates a skeleton file, and the files produced are then concatenated to create a single file and the intermediate files are deleted. To be included in the skeleton file, a chunk of code needs to have the arguments <code>purl=TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>README.md</code> file is also generated by the Makefile and is simply a copy of the <code>index.md</code>. Only edit <code>index.md</code> if you want to make changes.</p>
